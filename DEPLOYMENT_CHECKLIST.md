## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
Make sure your backend has these environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_SENDER=your_verified_sendgrid_sender_email
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_32_characters
```

### Remove These (if they exist):
- ❌ `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
- ❌ `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
- ❌ `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

### Manual Steps to Complete:

1. **Clean Database:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Uncomment the last line in clearDatabase.js
   node clearDatabase.js
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Commit all changes to Git
   - Push to your repository
   - Redeploy on Render (or your platform)
   - Check logs to ensure SendGrid is working

3. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Commit frontend changes
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Test the new download flow

4. **Test All Flows:**
   - ✅ Register new user
   - ✅ Login/logout
   - ✅ Forgot password (check email)
   - ✅ Upload file to registered user
   - ✅ Check recipient email for QR code
   - ✅ Download file using decryption key
